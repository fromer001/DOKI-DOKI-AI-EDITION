# Important Notice

This is still a very early W.I.P subject to bugs, I'm very tired right now so I wont be able to go over everything but I'll answer some potential questions that might come up:


## How do I set it up?

I'll have detailed instructions once I wake up. In the meantime you can join the Discord server https://discord.gg/rDA7ehBSq7 and maybe someone can help you out


## Am I required/Need to pay for an API key? 

No. You're able to use any API/LLM model you want 100 percent free (You just need to know what you're doing but instructions on how to do this will be coming out soon,
as well as modifications to the code to make this easier)
By playing DDAE you agree that you understand that paying for any API as an extention to this mod is your optional choice and is not at all required to play.

Some suggested APIS currently are OpenAI (for text), getimgai (for image), stablediffusionapi (for image). You can modify the files to use locally hosted LLMs (This is on the roadmap)



## Goal

One of the goals w/ this project isnt just to have an AI speak to you but also include stories alongside the AI generated text. Currently a snippet of that is seen in the first section but ideally would want to expand on that way more.
